Problem: Find the average grade for each subject and also 
identify the teacher teaching the subject along with the student 
who has scored the highest grade in each subject.

Sure, here's what the output could look like based on the dummy data:

| SubjectName | TeacherName | AvgGrade | StudentName | TopScore |
|-------------|-------------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Math        | Mr. Smith   | 88.6     | Amy         | 100      |
| History     | Mrs. Johnson| 86.5     | Jake        | 95       |
| Chemistry   | Dr. Miller  | 83.3     | Jake        | 92       |
| English     | Mr. Brown   | 80.8     | Amy         | 98       |

Here are some interpretations from the table:

- The subject Math, taught by Mr. Smith, has an average grade of 88.6, and the student with the highest score in Math is Amy with a score of 100.
- The subject History, taught by Mrs. Johnson, has an average grade of 86.5, and the student with the highest score in History is Jake with a score of 95.
- The subject Chemistry, taught by Dr. Miller, has an average grade of 83.3, and the student with the highest score in Chemistry is Jake with a score of 92.
- The subject English, taught by Mr. Brown, has an average grade of 80.8, and the student with the highest score in English is Amy with a score of 98.
